# CacheExplorer

A free account on https://www.acrcloud.com is required to activate audio recognition.

Can also be used as mp3 tagger, just drop any files on it.

It's currently unstable, but I'm already trying to read the index and data files from chrome to get more info without copying all files to a temporary folder.
